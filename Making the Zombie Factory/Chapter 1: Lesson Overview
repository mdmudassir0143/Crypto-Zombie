we're going to build a "Zombie Factory" to build an army of zombies.

Our factory will maintain a database of all zombies in our army
Our factory will have a function for creating new zombies
Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance

How Zombie DNA Works
The zombie's appearance will be based on its "Zombie DNA". Zombie DNA is simple â€” it's a 16-digit integer, like:

8356281049284737
Just like real DNA, different parts of this number will map to different traits. The first 2 digits map to the zombie's head type, the second 2 digits to the zombie's eyes, etc.
