//Internal and External
//In addition to public and private, Solidity has two more types of visibility for functions: internal and external.

//internal is the same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract. (Hey, that sounds like what we want here!).

//external is similar to public, except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract â€” they can't be called by other functions inside that contract.*/
